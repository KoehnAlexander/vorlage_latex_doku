The following work examines the components of a vehicle prototype based on defined criteria, which is equipped with different screens, video projectors and light generators to create an artistic overall staging of the vehicle. The test results were determined through independent research and interviews with experts for individual areas. The aim of the investigation is to use the results to develop concepts for controlling the components in existing vehicle architectures and to evaluate these different concepts. \\
The concept with a connection of the high-resolution elements to Automotive Ethernet or MOST and the connection of the less data-intensive elements to the CAN bus was rated as the most effective in terms of aspects.
