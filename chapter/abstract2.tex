The following work examines the components of a vehicle prototype on the basis of defined criteria in the areas of legal, economic and technical. The examined vehicle has different digital media for the creation of an overall artistic presentation, such as screens, video projectors and light generators. \\
The test results were determined through independent research and in consultation with experts. The aim of the investigation is, on the one hand, to obtain initial findings for the further development of the components. On the other hand, the goal is to use the analysis results to develop concepts for controlling the components in vehicle bus architectures and to evaluate these different concepts. \\
The analysis found out that the components need a powerful bus system, such as MOST (Media Oriented Systems Transport) or Automotive Ethernet, to meet the given requirements. The conceptual design with a decentralized storage of the data is the most effective architecture in comparison, since lower data rates of the bus systems are required there.
